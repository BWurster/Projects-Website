# Personal-Website

This is the source control for my personal website: https://benwursterprojects.com

This was a great webite project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It layed a foundational layer upon which I can build my knowledge of more 
streamlined and efficient technologies. This page will soon be usurped by a more comprehensive website I am currently in the process of building
using Gatsby, React, and SASS. For now, enjoy the website and its contents. Know however, that it will soon be a relic of the past.
