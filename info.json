    "welcome": "This is the second version of a project repository website I made in 2020 to showcase the many small personal projects that I love to do. This page is from-scratch, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I derived great joy from having complete control over the quality of the page you are currently viewing. Please feel free to browse the projects that are listed below and read about my personal journey and takeaways from each one. Also do not hesitate to reach out to me via the \"Contacts\" tab in the upper right corner of the screen with comments, questions, project ideas, or business inquiries. Enjoy the site! -Ben",

            "Hello and thank you for visiting the page about me! In case you missed it, my name is Ben Wurster, and I am a 4th-year student at University of Wisconsin-Madison triple-majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I have great passion for ideas and emerging technologies related to these subjects. Through my education I seek to attain the broad skill set necessary to add greater technical depth to my personal endeavors and to be involved in projects with tangible effects.",
            "As this site may suggest, one of my hobbies is the pursuit of small, personal projects that explore technology. I like to draw both from prinicples  in computer science and programming as well as mechanics and design. I seek to learn or apply a new skill in every project because I see each one as, at a deeper level, something carrying more weight than a small, insignificant project. Building a technical skill set takes applied time and effort. Each project is a point along the arc that brings me to where I want to be in the future: having the skills necessary to have a massive positive impact and influence in the world.",
            "Beyond projects, I engage in many other activities to lead a balanced lifestyle. I take great joy in being physically active. Recently, my passion for physical activity has found me running, biking, swimming, playing soccer, doing yoga, and lifing all multiple times within any given week. Put simply, I am happiest when exercising.",
            "Reading and listening to music are some other side interests of mine. I am currently reading the <i>Foundation</i> series by Isaac Asimov and plan to read some personal investment and finance non-fiction books after I am done with those. My favorite music genre is EDM. It is a beautiful genre because anyone with a computer can make music, leading to the purest form of self expression from talented artists that can rise out of a low barrier to entry.",
            "So there is a little bit about me. If you want to connect for any reason, look to the \"Contact\" tab in the menu above. I hope that you enjoy browsing this site as much as I did making it.",
            "-Ben"
